# gdvariant

Go based Encoding/Decoding of Godot Variant types

## Status

This package is in an alpha state, and not fully implemented.
Enough parts of the spec are implemented that fit my immediate needs.

There is enough implemented to get a good idea of how the rest can be implemented, PRs welcome.
